I'm studying with HyperionDev to learn about Data Science and open new opportunities with the hopes of starting a long term career in tech and AI.  I'm a complete newbie to coding, but as the great Walt Disney said:

## What Do I Have To Offer?
**Great** Question...

1. Passion
2. Enthusiasm
3. Discipline
4. Emojis
5. A Large Appetite

I'm a 35 year old Husband & Father.

I want a work/life balance where both are equally respected.

I will deliver my best to you and in return I want your best delivered to me.
